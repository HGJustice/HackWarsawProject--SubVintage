Project Description:

Seeing the disapproval of popular apps like Vinted and Depop inspired the creation of SubVintage. This decentralised, community-driven app for reselling clothes operates on the Avalanche network. By enabling peer-to-peer trades, we offer lower fees than competitors. Features include decentralised customer service, where users staking ETH as collateral assist in escrow disputes and earn rewards in our token. Additionally, a DAO allows users to vote on banning fake item listings and users with poor reputations, rewarding active community members for their participation in maintaining the appâ€™s integrity.
